#  Battery status Scan and Alert

This project targets the problem that raises on laptops when Windows has lost the hability to let you know when your laptop's battery is about to run low. The script "battery - life status" is a separate tool to run a quick health check of your battery. As for the other two scripts, here is how to use them:

1. Place all the scripts in a folder that you don't want to move them from in the future.
2. Save all your work and unplug your charger. 
3. Run the "battery - lowest capacity scan" script
4. Do something like web-surfing as you let your laptop uncharge until it shuts down.
5. Plug your charger back in, turn on your laptop, run the "battery - status - Alert" script and follow the instructions at the end of it so Windows can run it automatically everytime you start Windows.
